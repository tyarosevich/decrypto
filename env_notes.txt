##### Container Env Notes ######

Currently using the Nvidia NGC Pytorch container. A few notes:

- You had to add yourself as a user to the docker group (the group had already been created), and login with an API key from NGC.
- The container says it has a conda env. The documentation is wrong and all over the place. There is no conda env, it's not 3.8, it's not 3.5
  but the base python 3.10 install inthe container appears to be the intended interpreter and has pytorch etc installed.
- Pycharm does not support the right docker-compose features and as a workaround, your SYSTEM (not container) /etc/docker/daemon.json file needs
  to be updated to include the following line above the "runtimes" key:

  	- "default-runtime": "nvidia", 

  this appears to fix the problem, and my 3060 is recognized when running the env in Pycharm.
